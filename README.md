# Shop_Management_System

The Student Management System is a console-based Java application designed to manage student information efficiently using CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
This project integrates Java with a relational database using JDBC, allowing student data to be stored, retrieved, updated, and deleted permanently using SQL queries.

The application follows a menu-driven approach, where users interact through the console to perform different operations. Each user action triggers predefined SQL statements that communicate with the database, ensuring reliable and consistent data management.

This system allows administrators to:
      - Add new student records to the database
      - View individual or all student records
      - Update existing student information such as name, age, course, or marks
      - Delete student records when they are no longer required

All operations are executed using JDBC APIs and SQL queries (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE), demonstrating how Java applications handle persistent data storage.
